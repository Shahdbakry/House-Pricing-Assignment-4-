# California Housing Price Prediction

This project is part of Assignment 4 in my GTC Machine Learning Internship Track.
The objective is to build a machine learning model that predicts house prices in California.

# Project Steps

1- Load the dataset (housing.csv).

2- Explore the data: check structure, summary statistics, missing values, and target distribution.

3- Data cleaning:

- Handle missing values.

- Encode categorical feature ocean_proximity.

4- Split the data into training and test sets.

5- Build the model using Linear Regression.

6- Evaluate performance using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R² score.

7- Visualize predictions with an Actual vs Predicted plot.

# Results

- The Linear Regression model captures the general trend of housing prices.

- Evaluation metrics:

  - RMSE: (calculated in notebook)
  
  - R² Score: (calculated in notebook)

- Understanding the importance of data preprocessing.
